it is not possible to close stream on server side

so we need to wait until stream is closed or client is closed connection

there is a server options for this case - MaxConnectionAge with MaxConnectionAgeGrace
that must be tested first - https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc@v1.56.2/keepalive#ServerParameters

so, max TTL for endless stream from client is a MaxConnectionAge + MaxConnectionAgeGrace
