# Dynamic gRPC Output Plugin

The `dynamic_grpc` output can produce events using unary RPCs or client streams. Server streaming will be added in future releases.

Event routing key must be a full RPC name from `proto_files`. If RPC:
 - unary - an individual call is made for each event;
 - client stream - **one** stream is performed for each batch of events.

Plugin creates one caller per each unique event routing key, with personal batch controller. By the way, gRPC client shares between callers.

Each event will be encoded using [protomap](https://github.com/gekatateam/protomap). Concrete message descriptor takes from RPC input.
